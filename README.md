## 🌟 Key Features

- **Floating Timer Widget** — A small always-on-top window so you always see your timer, positioned at the corner of your app
- **Client & Project Management** — Organize your work with clients and projects
- **Offline Invoicing** — Create professional PDF invoices without needing the internet
- **Global Keyboard Shortcuts** — Control the timer from anywhere:
  - `Cmd+Shift+S` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Win/Linux) — Start/Resume
  - `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Win/Linux) — Pause
  - `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Win/Linux) — Stop & Save

- **Dashboard Analytics** — Visual breakdown of your daily and weekly progress
- **Smart Idle Detection** — Automatically pauses the timer when you step away
- **Customizable UI** — Light/Dark theme, adjustable font size and density
- **100% Offline** — All data stored locally in SQLite, no cloud required

## 🛡️ Data Protection

FlowForge-Track includes built-in protection against accidental data loss:

- **Cascading Delete Protection** — You cannot delete a client that has projects, or a project that has time entries
- **Delete Order** — To remove a client completely, you must first delete their time entries, then projects, then the client
- **No Undo Needed** — This deliberate friction prevents accidental deletion of important billing data
